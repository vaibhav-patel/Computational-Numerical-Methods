in problem 1:
    As iterations increases ratio first increases and then tends to be constant
    the greatest allowable error is 0.000000001
    with this precision after 26 iterations xn becomes almost constant
    the root of the function is situated at (0.0000,0.00000)

in problem 2:

    In bisection method:
    ratio of x(n+1) and x(n) is nearly 0.5
    After 25 iterations the difference between x(n+1) and x(n) tends to zero(nearly 0.000000001)
    In this method root is at (-0.567143,0.000)
    
    In newton's method:
    As iterations increases ratio first increases and then tends to be constant
    the greatest allowable error is 0.000000001
    with this precision after 6 iterations xn becomes almost constant
    the root of the function is situated at (-0.567143,0.00000)
