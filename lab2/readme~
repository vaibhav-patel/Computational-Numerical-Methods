As we learnt in lectures
the rate of convergence is 2 in newton-raphson method.
1.6  in secant method 

but efficiency is p^(1/n) ;

in newton's method efficiency is 1.4142
in secant method 1.618 

the number of functions to evaluate is two in newton's method
one in secant method
and three in another method which is given in question


no of iterations in newton's method is 6
no of iterations in secant method is 8
